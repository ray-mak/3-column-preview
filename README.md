<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is just a very simple 3 column preview component that I put together to practice React. Since this is the first component I've built with React, I wanted to practice on something simple. </p>

<h2>My Process</h2>
<p>I basically wrote all the HTML on one JSX document first, and then styled it with CSS. I essentially built out the page like I normally would using HTML and CSS, except I with JSX syntax. Then I broke the components down into pieces and put them into different JSX documents. I proceeded to import and export the necessary documents and files. Overall, it was rather simple and straightforward. It probably would have been more efficient just using HTML and CSS, but I wanted to get my feet wet with some JSX practice. I noticed the card layout was something that can be re-used, so I used this opportunity to try out React.</p>
